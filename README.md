# Text Differ

> **Note:** This project was entirely generated by AI using GitHub Copilot.

A robust Node.js application for comparing three text files side-by-side. It features a modern dark theme, local file browsing, drag-and-drop support, and the ability to export comparisons as standalone HTML files.

## Features

-   **3-Way Comparison**: Load and compare up to three text files simultaneously.
-   **Visual Diffs**: Clear, color-coded difference highlighting (additions, deletions).
-   **File Browser**: Integrated local file browser to easily navigate and select files.
-   **Drag & Drop**: Drag files directly onto the application window or the executable icon.
-   **Standalone Executable**: Can be packaged into a single `.exe` file for portable use without installing Node.js.
-   **Screenshot Export**: Generate a full-length screenshot of the comparison (including collapsed sections) and copy it directly to the clipboard.
-   **Auto Shutdown**: The backend server automatically shuts down when the browser tab is closed.
-   **Dark Theme**: Designed for comfortable viewing.

## Installation

### From Source

1.  Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2.  Clone or download this repository.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Running from Source

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building the Executable

To create a standalone `.exe` file:
```bash
npm run build
```
The executable will be created in the `built/` directory.

### Using the Executable

1.  Run `text-differ.exe` to start the application.
2.  **Drag & Drop**: You can drag text files directly onto the `.exe` icon to launch the application with those files pre-loaded.
3.  **Command Line**:
    ```bash
    text-differ.exe file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
    ```

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js** & **Express**: Backend server.
-   **pkg**: For packaging the application into an executable.
-   **jsdiff**: For computing text differences.
-   **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Frontend interface.
